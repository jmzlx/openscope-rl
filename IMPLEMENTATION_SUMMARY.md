## Technical Highlights

### 1. Variable-Length Input Handling
Uses Transformer architecture with attention masking to handle 0-20 aircraft elegantly without padding waste.

### 2. Game Integration
Playwright automation allows training directly in the browser without modifying game source code.

### 3. Reward Shaping
Combines sparse game rewards with dense auxiliary rewards:
- Game score changes (±1000 for collisions, ±10 for landings)
- Conflict warnings (-1 to -5)
- Safe operation bonuses (+0.05)
- Timestep penalty (-0.01)

### 4. Action Masking
Prevents invalid actions by masking out non-existent aircraft, ensuring the agent only selects valid targets.

### 5. Curriculum Learning
Four-stage curriculum from simple (1 aircraft) to complex (20+ aircraft), enabling stable learning progression.

### 6. Efficient Training
- Timewarp acceleration (5-10x)
- Batch processing
- Parallel environment support (configurable)
- GPU acceleration

## Usage Example

```bash
# Setup
cd rl_training
./setup.sh
source venv/bin/activate

# Start game server (in another terminal)
cd ..
npm run start

# Train
python train.py --config config/training_config.yaml --wandb

# Evaluate
python evaluate.py --checkpoint checkpoints/checkpoint_100000.pt

# Visualize
python visualize_training.py --log-file logs/training_log_*.jsonl
```

## Performance Expectations

### Training Time
- **10M steps**: ~20-40 hours (depending on hardware and timewarp)
- **First improvements**: Visible after 100K steps
- **Decent performance**: ~2M steps
- **Near-optimal**: ~10M steps

### Hardware Requirements
- **Minimum**: CPU only, 8GB RAM (slow)
- **Recommended**: GPU (NVIDIA), 16GB RAM
- **Optimal**: RTX 3080+ or better, 32GB RAM

### Expected Results
After full training (10M steps):
- Mean episode score: +100 to +200
- Success rate: 80-90%
- Collision rate: <1%
- Separation loss rate: <5%

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Transformer?
- Handles variable aircraft count naturally
- Captures interactions between aircraft
- Attention mechanism learns separation rules
- Scalable to larger scenarios

### Why PPO?
- Stable and sample-efficient
- Works well with complex action spaces
- Proven track record in games
- Easy to tune

### Why Hierarchical Actions?
- Reduces action space size
- More interpretable
- Matches human controller workflow
- Easier to mask invalid actions

### Why Browser Automation?
- No game modification needed
- Uses actual game physics
- Realistic training environment
- Easy to update game version

## Potential Extensions

1. **Multi-Agent**: Each aircraft as independent agent
2. **Multi-Airport**: Train across different airports
3. **Imitation Learning**: Bootstrap with expert demonstrations
4. **Distributed Training**: Ray/RLlib for parallelization
5. **Better State Representation**: Add weather, runway config, etc.
6. **Sophisticated Reward**: Learn from human preferences
7. **Transfer Learning**: Pre-train on simple scenarios
8. **Model Compression**: Distill to smaller model for deployment

## Known Limitations

1. **Browser Overhead**: Playwright adds latency (~100ms per action)
2. **JavaScript Extraction**: May break with game updates
3. **Single Environment**: No parallel environments by default
4. **Discrete Actions**: Continuous control might be better
5. **Observation Noise**: Game state extraction not perfect
6. **Training Time**: Requires significant compute for full convergence

## Future Work

- [ ] Implement parallel environments with Ray
- [ ] Add imitation learning from expert trajectories
- [ ] Support multiple airports in curriculum
- [ ] Optimize state extraction (faster JS injection)
- [ ] Add communication layer for better integration
