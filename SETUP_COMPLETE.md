- `.trees/07-cosmos-world-model/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Game-Changer)

### 5. Documentation
- `EXPERIMENT_ROADMAP.md` - Complete overview of all 7 approaches
- `QUICK_START.md` - Step-by-step getting started guide
- `SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - This file!

### 6. Updated Configuration
- `.gitignore` - Added worktrees, models, training artifacts

## Summary of Approaches

| # | Approach | Priority | Key Feature | Expected Timeline |
|---|----------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Baseline PPO + Action Masking | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Sample efficiency | 2-3 days |
| 2 | Hierarchical RL | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | Interpretability | 3-4 days |

| 6 | Trajectory Transformer | Research | World model | 4-5 days |
| 7 | Cosmos World Model | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | 10-100x efficiency | 5-7 days |

## Recommended Starting Order

### Week 1: Establish Baselines
1. **Baseline PPO** (`.trees/01-baseline-ppo/`)
   - Start here to establish performance baseline
   - Action masking for 2-3x sample efficiency
   - Uses proven PPO algorithm

2. **Decision Transformer** (`.trees/05-decision-transformer/`)
   - Transformer-based approach (leverages your existing code!)
   - Offline learning from recorded episodes
   - Return conditioning for behavior control

### Week 2: Advanced Approaches
3. **Cosmos World Model** (`.trees/07-cosmos-world-model/`)
   - Revolutionary approach using NVIDIA Cosmos
   - Perfect for your 2x DGX + RTX 5090 hardware
   - 10-100x sample efficiency if successful

## Quick Verification

Run these commands to verify setup:

```bash
# List all worktrees
./scripts/list_worktrees.sh

# Check shared utilities exist
ls experiments/*.py

# Check implementation guides exist
ls .trees/01-baseline-ppo/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
ls .trees/05-decision-transformer/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
ls .trees/07-cosmos-world-model/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md

# Verify Git branches
git branch | grep experiment/
```

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Start with Baseline PPO (Recommended)
```bash
cd .trees/01-baseline-ppo
cat IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
# Follow the step-by-step guide
```

### Option 2: Start with Decision Transformer
```bash
cd .trees/05-decision-transformer
cat IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
# Leverage your existing transformer architecture
```

### Option 3: Start with Cosmos (Advanced)
```bash
cd .trees/07-cosmos-world-model
cat IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
# Revolutionary approach, high risk/reward
```

## Key Files to Read

1. **QUICK_START.md** - Read this first for immediate next steps
2. **EXPERIMENT_ROADMAP.md** - Read for complete overview
3. **.trees/XX/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Read for specific approach details

## Success Criteria

**Infrastructure Setup** ‚úÖ:
- [x] 7 worktrees created
- [x] Shared utilities implemented
- [x] Implementation guides written
- [x] Documentation complete

**Next Phase** (Implementation):
- [ ] Baseline PPO working (70%+ success rate)
- [ ] Decision Transformer trained (offline learning demonstrated)
- [ ] Cosmos integrated (world model fine-tuned)
- [ ] Benchmark comparison completed
- [ ] Best approach identified

## Architecture Benefits

‚úÖ **Isolation**: Each approach in separate worktree, no conflicts
‚úÖ **Parallel**: Can work on multiple approaches simultaneously
‚úÖ **Shared**: Common utilities ensure fair comparison
‚úÖ **Flexible**: Easy to abandon or merge approaches
‚úÖ **Reproducible**: Implementation guides ensure consistency

## Hardware Utilization Plan

Your setup is PERFECT for this:

- **2x DGX with NVLink**: 
  - Cosmos fine-tuning (heavy workload)
  - Large-scale PPO training
  - Distributed training experiments

- **RTX 5090**:
  - Development and testing
  - Decision Transformer training
  - Cosmos inference

- **MacBook Pro M4 Max 48GB**:
  - Running Jupyter notebooks
  - Visualization and analysis
  - Coordination and documentation

## Total Time Investment

**Infrastructure Setup**: ~3 hours (COMPLETE! ‚úÖ)

**Implementation** (estimated):
- Baseline PPO: 16-24 hours
- Decision Transformer: 24-32 hours  
- Cosmos Integration: 40-56 hours
- Evaluation & Comparison: 8-16 hours

**Total**: ~2-4 weeks of focused work to explore all three priority approaches

## Current Status
