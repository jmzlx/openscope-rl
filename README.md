## 🎮 The OpenScope Environment

### What is OpenScope?

OpenScope is an open-source, web-based air traffic control simulator that provides:

- **180+ Real Airports**: Including KJFK, KLAS, KSEA, EGLL, and more
- **Realistic Physics**: Aircraft acceleration, turning rates, wind effects
- **Standard ATC Procedures**: ILS approaches, SIDs, STARs, holding patterns
- **Conflict Detection**: Real-time separation violation monitoring
- **Scoring System**: Penalties for conflicts, violations, and inefficiency

### Our Gymnasium Wrapper

The `PlaywrightEnv` class wraps OpenScope in a standard Gymnasium interface:

```python
from environment import PlaywrightEnv

# Create environment
env = PlaywrightEnv(
    airport="KLAS",           # Las Vegas McCarran
    max_aircraft=20,          # Track up to 20 aircraft
    timewarp=5,               # 5x speed
    headless=False,           # Show browser window
    reward_strategy="default" # Reward calculation method
)

# Standard RL loop
obs, info = env.reset()
for _ in range(1000):
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
    if terminated or truncated:
        break
```

### Observation Space

The environment provides structured observations with the following components:

**1. Aircraft Features** (`shape: (max_aircraft, 14)`)
- Position (x, y) - Normalized coordinates
- Altitude, heading, speed, ground speed
- Assigned altitude, heading, speed (from previous commands)
- Boolean flags: is_on_ground, is_taxiing, is_established
- Category: is_arrival, is_departure

**2. Aircraft Mask** (`shape: (max_aircraft,)`)
- Boolean mask indicating which aircraft slots are active
- Handles variable number of aircraft (0 to max_aircraft)

**3. Global State** (`shape: (4,)`)
- Current simulation time (hours)
- Aircraft density (fraction of max_aircraft)
- Conflict density (conflicts per aircraft)
- Current score (normalized)

**4. Conflict Matrix** (`shape: (max_aircraft, max_aircraft)`)
- Pairwise conflict information
- Values: 0 (no conflict), 0.5 (predicted conflict), 1.0 (separation violation)
- Symmetric matrix for efficient attention mechanisms

### Action Space

Actions are represented as discrete dictionaries:

```python
{
    "aircraft_id": int,      # 0 to max_aircraft (max_aircraft = no-op)
    "command_type": int,     # 0=altitude, 1=heading, 2=speed, 3=ILS, 4=direct
    "altitude": int,         # Altitude level (0-40, representing 0-40,000 ft)
    "heading": int,          # Heading change (-180 to +180 degrees, quantized)
    "speed": int,            # Speed level (140-520 knots, quantized)
}
```

**Command Types:**
- **ALTITUDE**: Change target altitude
- **HEADING**: Change heading (turn left/right)
- **SPEED**: Change target speed
- **ILS**: Establish on ILS approach
- **DIRECT**: Direct to waypoint/fix

**No-Op Action**: Setting `aircraft_id = max_aircraft` performs no action, allowing the agent to "wait and observe."

### Reward Structure

The environment supports multiple reward strategies:

**Default Strategy:**
- +10 per aircraft successfully exited
- -50 per conflict detected
- -200 per separation violation
- -0.1 per time step (efficiency incentive)
- -500 episode termination penalty (if score too low)

**Safety-Focused Strategy:**
- Higher penalties for conflicts/violations
- Lower rewards for successful exits
- Emphasis on maintaining separation

**Efficiency-Focused Strategy:**
- Higher rewards for quick exits
- Lower penalties for minor conflicts
- Emphasis on throughput

Custom reward strategies can be implemented by subclassing `RewardCalculator`.

## 📊 Data Collection

The project includes a comprehensive data collection pipeline for offline RL and imitation learning.

### Training Data Collector

The `TrainingDataCollector` class collects complete episode trajectories:

```python
from data.training_data_collector import TrainingDataCollector

collector = TrainingDataCollector(
    output_dir="training_data",
    airport="KLAS",
    max_aircraft=10,
    save_raw_states=True,  # Include full game state
    save_wind_data=True,   # Include wind components
)

# Collect episodes with different policies
episodes = collector.collect_episodes(
    num_episodes=100,
    policy="random",        # Options: "random", "heuristic", "expert"
    max_steps=1000,
)
```

### What Data is Collected?

Each episode contains:

**1. Observations** (normalized for RL)
- Aircraft features (position, velocity, state)
- Conflict matrix
- Global environment state
- All aligned with Gymnasium observation space

**2. Actions** (discrete action dictionaries)
- Aircraft selection
- Command type and parameters
- Recorded in environment format

**3. Rewards** (float per step)
- Calculated using specified reward strategy
- Includes all components (conflicts, exits, efficiency)

**4. Episode Metadata**
- Episode length (steps)
- Total reward
- Final score
- Violation count
- Conflict count
- Successful landings/departures

**5. Returns-to-Go** (computed automatically)
- Cumulative future rewards from each step
- Used for Decision Transformer training

**6. Raw State Data** (optional, for analysis)
- Complete OpenScope game state
- Wind components (via `getWindComponents()` method)
- Runway assignments
- Flight plans
- All aircraft details

### Dataset Structure

Collected data is saved in pickle format with the following structure:

```
training_data/
├── ep_00000_random.pkl       # Individual episodes
├── ep_00001_random.pkl
├── ...
└── dataset_summary.json      # Dataset statistics
```

**Dataset Summary:**
```json
{
  "num_episodes": 100,
  "total_transitions": 45230,
  "avg_episode_length": 452.3,
  "avg_reward": -234.5,
  "total_violations": 23,
  "total_conflicts": 156,
  "airport": "KLAS",
  "max_aircraft": 10,
  "observation_info": { ... }
}
```

### Offline RL Dataset

For offline RL algorithms (Decision Transformer, CQL, etc.), use the `OfflineRLDataset`:

```python
from data.offline_dataset import OfflineDatasetCollector, OfflineRLDataset
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

# Collect episodes
collector = OfflineDatasetCollector(env)
episodes = collector.collect_random_episodes(num_episodes=500)
episodes += collector.collect_heuristic_episodes(num_episodes=300)

# Create PyTorch dataset
dataset = OfflineRLDataset(
    episodes=episodes,
    context_len=20,      # Transformer context window
    max_aircraft=20,
    state_dim=14,        # Aircraft feature dimension
    scale_returns=True,  # Normalize returns
)

# Create dataloader
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

# Training loop
for batch in dataloader:
    returns = batch["returns"]           # (B, T, 1)
    states = batch["states"]             # (B, T, N, 14)
    actions = batch["actions"]           # Dict of (B, T)
    timesteps = batch["timesteps"]       # (B, T)
    attention_mask = batch["attention_mask"]  # (B, T)
    # ... train model
```

The dataset automatically handles:
- Variable-length episodes (padding/truncating to context_len)
- Return scaling (for training stability)
- Attention masks (for valid timesteps)
- Batching with collation

### Data Collection Policies

**Random Policy:**
- Samples actions uniformly from action space
- Useful for exploration and baseline dataset

**Heuristic Policy:**
- Simple rule-based controller
- Resolves conflicts by altitude/heading changes
- 70% no-op rate (avoids over-controlling)

**Expert Policy:** (Coming soon)
- Advanced rule-based controller
- Implements ATC best practices
- For behavioral cloning

**Custom Policy:**
```python
def my_policy(obs):
    # Your policy logic
    return action

episodes = collector.collect_custom_policy_episodes(
    policy_fn=my_policy,
    num_episodes=100,
)
```

## 🔧 Setup

   ```bash
   uv sync
   uv run playwright install chromium
   ```

2. **Start OpenScope server** (in parent directory):
   ```bash
   cd ../openscope
